happstack-websockets
====================

This library provides support for using WebSockets with Happstack.

The `example` directory contains an example echo server and
client. The client is a bit lack luster at the moment. It sends a
single request to the server and logs the response to console.

Clearly an example that looks like it is actually doing something
would be nicer.

This library is mostly just a thin wrapper around the
[websockets](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/websockets) library.
